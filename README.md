# Robust.Buttplug Library
Fork of the [official Buttplug.io C# Library](https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-csharp) to make it plug-and-play (üòè) with the RobustToolbox engine (namely getting around the sandbox by including this library). Allows controlling compatible devices from software.

## Usage
Include this repo as a submodule and include both the `Robust.Buttplug` and `Robust.Buttplug.Client.Connectors.WebsocketConnector` projects in your project (probably the client).  
Needs a compatible server running in the background (such as Intiface Central)
